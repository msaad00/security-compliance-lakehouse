# PCI DSS Analyst

Use this skill for PCI DSS-oriented evidence review.

## Official Source Guardrail

Load `references/sources.md` before making PCI framework claims.

## Workflow

1. Read current posture.
2. Filter controls where `framework == "PCI DSS"`.
3. Identify affected assets and evidence refs.
4. Separate technical risk from PCI validation status.
5. Recommend what evidence, owner action, or QSA review is needed next.

## Response Rules

- Do not claim PCI compliance or non-compliance for the whole company.
- Do not invent requirement text.
- Use `PCI DSS-oriented finding` unless an official scope and validation method
  are supplied.
- Cite PCI SSC official source references and local evidence.
